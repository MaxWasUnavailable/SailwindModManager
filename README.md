# Sailwind Mod Manager

---

The Sailwind Mod Manager is an open source mod manager for the Sailwind community.

It currently allows you to browse and download mods.

Future plans include:
* Installing and managing of mod installations.
* Save management & backups.
* Favouriting & categorising of mods.
* Making of mod collections / modpacks.

### Central mod repository

Mods are hosted on the Sailwind Mod Repository, which you can find here:

### Contributing

If you would like to help contribute to this project, please contact Max `(Max#0007)` on the Sailwind Discord server!

The project is written in Python 3.9, using Qt through PySide2.

If you have an idea for a new feature, please do run it by me first; that way we can ensure that it fits within the planned scope of the project, and that we don't already have other people working on the same thing.
